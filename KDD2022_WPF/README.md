# Team zhangshijin Baidu KDD CUP 2022 Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting Challenge Technical Report
## 1.Introduction
The use of wind power, a pollution-free and renewable form of
energy, to generate electricity has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. However, intermittent electricity generation resulting
from the stochastic nature of wind speed poses challenges to the
safety and stability of electric power grids. For the efficient use of
wind energy, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration,
and it aims to accurately estimate the wind power supply of wind
farms at different time scales.

## 3.Model Training and Testing

```
for train Deep models:
    python /home/user/david/kdd/Data_Competitions/KDD2022_WPF/main.py --conf ./config/config_clear_st_18.yaml

for train P2Ptree:
    cd ./P2Ptree/code/
    python train_parallel.py

for test:
    python kddcup22-sdwpf-evaluation/paddlepaddle/evaluation.py
```
The trained model will be saved in `output_path` directory.

lightgb>=3.1.1
pgl==2.2.3post0
paddlepaddle-gpu>=2.3.0.post112
```
## 5.Data Engineering Based on Wind Power Curves

We first analyze the anomaly of the dataset, such as missing data, unknown data, and other singularities, by performing anomaly detection according to the wind power
curve. And then perform the data processing to deal with these anomalies.

Anomaly detection:

## 6.Model Architecture

Inspired by the innovations from Autoformer and FEDformer, our model uses an encoder-decoder structure that includes sequence decomposition using average pooling, auto-correlation
mechanism for sequence-level connections, multi-head attention from original transformer, graph neural network encoding and feedforward module, as shown below.

## 7.Point-by-point prediction based on tree model (P2Ptree)

Besides building a deep learning model with PaddlePaddle to predict future wind power generation, we also build the LightGBM model to reduce prediction variance and increase generability by
ensembling different models.
Thus, we reduce the number of models in the following two ways: clustering of wind turbines and downsampled power generation at time scale.
